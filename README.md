# hello-world

Hi Humans

People call me crazy woman but I actually don't belong here. 5 years ago I was taking a space tour which went bad. I lost control of what you call spaceship and came in contact with your gravity. After that I lost contact with my people. Now I have finally accepted that I can not go back. So looking for a future here.
